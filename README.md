# language-Interpreter-Parser

This is an ongoing multistep process in creating a parser/interpreter for a few sample files the the language dart. The goal is I can intrepreter these files which all have different purposes.

# The Three Sample Files

- One file is a hello world file, just a basic file to begin parsing and interpreting 
- The second file is a Quadratic function file, this is where will start to use some math and and conditional statements to see if its easy to interpret 
- the third is a sorting algorithm using for loops, arrays, and more. 


This is currently still in production and will be continued to be added on to.
