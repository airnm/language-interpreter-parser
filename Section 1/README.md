# Identifiers:
Identifiers are used for naming variables and functions.
Identifiers in dart would include
- Must begin with a letter or underscore.
- Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, or underscores.
- Dart is case-sensitive.

# Special Words:
In these files theres:
- import
- double
- if
- else
- void 
- print
and special words are words with special meanings in the Dart language, and they cannot be used as identifiers.

# Literals:
Literals represent fixed values in Dart.
- The quadratic_formula code uses numeric literals (e.g., 1, -5, 6) to define coefficients.
- the sorting_algorithm uses lists of numbers like 64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90

# Math Operators: 
Math operators perform mathematical operations.
- both quadratic_formula and sorting_algorithm use math operators like +, -, *, / and % for arithmetic calculations.

# Relational Operators:
Relational operators compare values.
- sorting_algorithm uses <, > 

# Delimiters: 
Delimiters are symbols used to separate code elements.
- all of the code uses various delimiters, including (), {}, ;, and =>.

# Lists:
Lists are ordered collections in Dart
- sorting_algorithm uses lists

# Loops:
Loops are used for repetitive execution of code
- sorting_algorithm uses for Loops

# Branching:
Branching statements control the flow of the program.
Both quadratic_formula and sorting_algorithm use branching with if, else if, and else statements to determine the type and number of roots based on the discriminant value. while sorting_algorithm utilizes them to configure the order of numbers.
